Digital elevation model (DEM) is known as one of the most significant fundamental geographical data, the theory, method and application of which are hot research issues in geography, especially in geomorphology, hydrology, soil and other fields.

The CODE introduces a new analytical method "Spline-Fourier-series" method for high-precision seabed surface modelling, which reconstructs high-resolution DEMs form low-resolution DEMs.
