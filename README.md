# Spline-Fourier-series

This is a very simple version of Spline-Fourier-series method. Taking the calculation of parameters a_(p,mn)  (p=1) as an example, codes programmed by MATLAB software to construct high-precision seabed terrain surface from low resolution DEMs are presented. The complete version of this method will continuously updated on this web.

Digital elevation model (DEM) is known as one of the most significant fundamental geographical data, the theory, method and application of which are hot research issues in geography, especially in geomorphology, hydrology, soil and other fields.

The CODE introduces a new analytical method "Spline-Fourier-series" method for high-precision seabed surface modelling, which reconstructs high-resolution DEMs form low-resolution DEMs.
